# Introduction

Frappe Insights is an open-source project that helps you to analyze and optimize your business. It has been designed for a predictable and great user experience. It is built on top of [Frappe Framework](https://github.com/frappe/frappe) and is available for free.

Frappe Insights is currently in beta and is missing a bunch of essential features that any typical analytics platform should have. We are working hard to make it a great product and we are looking forward to your feedback.

This user guide includes a quick start guide and a list of all available features and how to use them. We hope you will find it useful.
