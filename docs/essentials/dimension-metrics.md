# Dimension and Metrics

Dimensions and metrics are the building blocks of your query. Dimensions are the attributes of your data, and metrics are the measurements of those attributes. Dimensions and metrics are used to create visualizations and dashboards.

Dimensions are used to group your data. For example, if you have a table of sales data, you can group your data by product category to see how much revenue each category is generating.

Metrics are used to measure your data. For example, if you have a table of sales data, you can measure the total revenue generated by each product category.

In this case, the product category is a dimension and revenue is a metric.

## Expressions

You can use expressions to create new metrics from existing metrics or to create new dimensions from existing dimensions. For example, you can create a new metric that calculates the percentage of revenue generated by each product category.

To write an expression, switch to the **Expressions** tab in the Dimensions & Metrics section.

## Formatting

You can format your dimensions and metrics to change the way they are displayed in your visualizations. For example, you can format a metric to display a percentage or a currency.

To format a dimension or metric, click the **Format** button next to the dimension or metric.
