# Table

A table is a collection of data organized in rows and columns. Tables are automatically imported when you create a new Data Source. You can browse the list of tables from the Data Source list.

## Joins

You can join two tables together in the query builder if there is a link created between them.

<div class="border rounded flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-50 w-full py-8" >
	<img class="shadow rounded-sm" src="./images/join.gif" alt="Joins" width="30%">
</div>

You can create a link between two tables while browsing the data source list.
